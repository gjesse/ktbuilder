#### motivation

One pain point of introducing kotlin into an java-heavy environment is that using data classes from java can be quite cumbersome, as java doesn't have the advantages of having named parameters. I wanted to see if I could use kotlinpoet to create an annotation processor to see if this could be accomplished automatically.
